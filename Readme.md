#UserInfo - AD information

## What does this tool?
A small tool I copied from the AutoIt forum and adjusted for my own environment. Thanks to [Marc](https://www.autoitscript.com/forum/topic/153072-active-directory-tool-userinfo/) for code!

## User manual

Just place the executable somewhere and run it! The rest should be self explanatory :)

## Tech Stack
All code is writen in AutoIt script. The compiled executable is ofcourse windows only...
